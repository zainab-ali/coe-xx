## The Craft of Emacs Cross Stitch Mode

This repository contains code to complement the [Craft of
Emacs](https://craft-of-emacs.kebab-ca.se) guide on Emacs Lisp
development.

 - `coe-xx.el` contains a major mode for editing cross-stitch
   patterns.
 - `coe-demo.el` contains a few functions to demonstrate the exercises
   in the guide.
 - Finally, there are several files wih the `.xx` extension. These correspond to cross stitch patterns.

Good luck on your Emacs journey!
